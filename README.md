# Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct Memory Estimation

This repository provides a detailed estimation of GPU memory requirements for generating text using the **Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct** model. The calculation assumes an input prompt of 4000 tokens and a generated output of 4000 tokens.

## Memory Requirement Formula

To estimate the GPU memory required, the following formula is used:

```markdown
Total Memory (GB) = (M * P / 10^9) + (T_in * L * H * A * P / 10^9) + (T_out * L * H * A * P / 10^9) + Overhead
```

Where:
- `M`: Number of parameters in the model (8 billion for Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct).
- `P`: Precision in bytes (2 bytes for FP16).
- `L`: Number of layers in the model.
- `H`: Hidden size (number of units in the hidden layer).
- `A`: Attention heads (number of attention heads in each layer).
- `T_in`: Input tokens (4000 tokens).
- `T_out`: Output tokens (4000 tokens).
- **Overhead**: Includes additional memory required by the framework and any other allocations (e.g., caching, padding, etc.).

## Example Calculation

Assume the following values for layers, hidden size, and attention heads:
- `L = 32` (number of layers)
- `H = 4096` (hidden size)
- `A = 32` (number of attention heads)

### 1. Model Parameters Memory:

```markdown
Model Memory (GB) = (8 * 10^9 * 2 / 10^9) = 16 GB
```

### 2. Intermediate Activations Memory:

```markdown
Activations Memory (GB) ≈ (4000 * 32 * 4096 * 32 * 2 / 10^9) * 2 ≈ 33 GB
```

### 3. Overhead:

```markdown
Overhead (GB) ≈ 4 GB
```

### Total Memory Estimate:

```markdown
Total Memory (GB) ≈ 16 GB (Model) + 33 GB (Activations) + 4 GB (Overhead) ≈ 53 GB
```

## Conclusion

For generating 4000 output tokens from a 4000-token input using **Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct** at FP16 precision, you would approximately need **53 GB** of GPU memory.

A **GPU with at least 48 GB to 80 GB of memory** (such as an NVIDIA A100 80GB) is recommended for this task.
